For boundaries we have to use at the one hand - 2nd order scheme, at the other - forward/backward scheme.

Tests show, that we cannot use center scheme even for infinite small h for boundary points, since it gives
function from other that Sobolev space for a given equation.

Thus, everything becomes more serious. Brace yourself, if you go further to the code
